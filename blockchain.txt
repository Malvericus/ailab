Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across many computers. It ensures that records cannot be altered retroactively. Blockchain gained popularity due to Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. Decentralization and transparency are two of its major benefits. Public blockchains are open to everyone, while private blockchains restrict access. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code. They operate on blockchain networks. Ethereum is a popular platform for creating smart contracts. Blockchain can transform industries like healthcare, supply chain, and finance. Data stored in blockchain is immutable. Consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work and Proof of Stake ensure security. Mining is the process of validating transactions. Energy consumption is a challenge in blockchain mining. Newer mechanisms aim to make blockchain more sustainable. Blockchain also enables decentralized applications (DApps). NFTs or Non-Fungible Tokens use blockchain technology. Scalability remains an issue for blockchain adoption. Layer-2 solutions aim to solve this scalability problem. The future of blockchain includes integration with AI and IoT.
